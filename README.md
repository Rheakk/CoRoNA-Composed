# CoRoNA-Composed
Data Project for CUEPID Data Challange (Track 2).

CoRoNA Composed is a mechanism to listen to COVID-19 as a piece of music. We musically encoded of three strains of the RdRp section of RNA in COVID-19. The strains were taken from the National Health Intitute's Genbank which keeps a collection of sequenced RNA from laboratories around the globe. We used music features from Google' Magenta Project to encode the data. 

The code is in Python as an .ipynb file. This repository also includes Tableau Workbook files for the data visualizations we made to supplement our musical compositions.
