# CoRoNA-Composed
Data Project for CUEPID Data Challange (Track 2).

CoRoNA Composed is a mechanism to listen to COVID-19 as a piece of music. We encoded three strains of RdRp in COVID-19 into musical compositions in Google Colab using Google Magenta's tools. The strains were taken from the National Health Intitute's Genbank which keeps a collection of sequenced RNA from laboratories around the globe.
